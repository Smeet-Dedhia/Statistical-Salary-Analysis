    The below charts plot Kernel Denisties, i.e. a histogram of sorts which shows the frequency of each salary.
    Separate plots for Males and Females are hightighed, along with their gender mean, so that a quick visual comparison can be made.
    Just like any other statistical methods, the difference in the means of males and females, expressed as a multiplr of the distribution standard error helps us quantify the gap.
    The appropriate statistical test statistic and p-value are also present in the graph legend along with its interpretation considered at the 0.05 significance level.
    Find  more information about these tests in our blog!
